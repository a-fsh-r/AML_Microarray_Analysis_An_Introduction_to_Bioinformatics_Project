## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focused on the **microarray analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)** – the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. AML originates in the bone marrow and leads to the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells.

## ⚙️ What We Did

1. **Data Loading**  
   Downloaded dataset from GEO (platform GPL6244) and filtered for AML and control samples.

2. **Data Exploration**  
   Generated boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and performed PCA for quality check and visualization.

3. **Differential Expression Analysis**  
   Used `limma` to find genes significantly up- or down-regulated in AML vs. CD34+ samples.

4. **Results**  
   Extracted gene lists with significant fold changes and adjusted p-values, saved in text files for further analysis.
